# ðŸŒ¿ Weed Detector â€“ YOLOv5 + Google Colab

This project detects weeds in crop field images using a **YOLOv5** deep learning model.  
It is designed for use in Google Colab but can also be run locally.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Weed detection using YOLOv5 object detection.
- Supports **image uploads** and **live camera input**.
- Pre-trained on a custom dataset from Roboflow.
- Outputs **annotated images** with detected weed locations.
- Can be adapted for different crops and weed types.
